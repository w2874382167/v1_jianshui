# Jianshui of Ancient city Integrated Media Website

## Website Type:

The front and rear ends are not separated as the main body, embedded with front and rear end separation

## Technical item: 

Python Django Vue Axios element ui

## Introduction:

This website serves as a starting point for interest and learning

Divided into homepage, news, large model, website navigation, backend page, login and registration page

### home page

A large number of articles were displayed (from the ancient city Jianshui WeChat official account). Click to read the articles in detail. The reading page is consistent with the display of the WeChat official account.

Some simple information displays, quick links to a mobile tour of Yunnan, Jianshui dialect tags, website information

Bottom display: As another interface for information supplementation, place the mouse on the right (click on the phone) to display the corresponding QR code. The website registration displayed is fake. The registration number of Yunnan Admissions Examination Institute this time is false

### News:

This page is full of data obtained through web crawling technology, and the data is real-time. WeChat's web crawling has not been implemented

### Large model:

Implement communication with artificial intelligence without distinguishing between users. All calls from individuals will be displayed together, only differentiated by date. The classification was not done well, mainly because I couldn't think of a better way

Model: Baidu's Spark Big Model

### Website Navigation:

I have compiled a list of commonly used websites



### The function introduction is incomplete

The rest of the pages require login to view. You can register and there is no danger involved

At this point, I think the development of the website can come to an end. Without a doubt, there are still some areas that were not done well and had bugs. Let's hastily end the first large-scale project like this!

But the development of the Jianshui website is only the first version, I think I will do it later!!!

## Write at the end

In November 2023, I started working on web pages. Although I didn't do it well, it was already my technical showcase for almost a year and the result of my three months of hard work
